本脚本为本人在实习期间为新华传媒p2p平台写的基于ocr库的Python脚本。我只上传了代码本体，识别用到的素材因为是新华传媒的数字资产所以均不上传。

This script is a Python script based on the OCR libraries and I wrote it for the p2p platform of Xinhua Media during my internship. I've only uploaded the code itself, but not the material used for identification because they're digital assets of Xinhua Media.

上传此代码的目的一是为了证明此程序由我创作以证明我在实习期间的作为，二是为了分享经验。接下来我会逐渐在代码中添加注释去解释为什么我会如此编辑代码，以及在哪些地方需要注意。

The purpose of uploading this code is to prove that I created this programme and to demonstrate that I've done sth during my internship as well as sharing my experience. I will gradually add comments to the code to explain why I do this and where attention should be paid.

此程序并非是上级要求我编写的，单纯是因为我想提升我和我同事今后的工作效率。我采用了Unlicense，希望能规避版权问题。

This programme was not written at the request of my superiors, but purely because I wanted to improve the efficiency of my work and that of my colleagues in the future. I used Unlicense, hoping to circumvent copyright issues.

*目前该代码还不是完全体，我的同事仍在提出新的要求和发现新的bug。

*The code is not fully fleshed out yet, and my colleagues are still making new requests and finding new bugs.

由于本地项目和这里存放的项目格式和命名都不同，所以我选择手动上传而不是用git。
I chose to upload it manually instead of using git since the local project is formatted and named differently than the one stored here.
